# EastCoastDuneGrass
This code accompanies a geographic literature review of the dune grasses Ammophila breviligulata and Uniola paniculata. 
Locations of the grasses are noted and this code maps those references. 
The code generates an HTML file (a leaflet map) that can be opened using a browser, and the map has active links to scientific articles.
